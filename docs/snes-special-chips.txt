These games have special chips for enhanced features on the SNES. Only the
DSP1 games will run on a copier if a DSP cartridge or adapter is installed.
Game Genie works, but can not be appended to a ROM for game enhancing features.
Some games will run if the original of the same game is plugged into the SNES
copier while running the program from RAM. These are: Megaman X2, Megaman X3,
and Super Bases Loaded 2.

Addendum:

BS-X SatellaView
================
The Satellaview consists of two units.. the base unit which connected to the IO port on the
bottom of the SNES and the BS-X cart which went in the top of the SNES.

The Satellaview system connected to St. Giga, the Satellite provider. The unit would connect and
make new content available for download.

Games on the system were often exclusive to the Satellaview, and can't be found anywhere else.
They were also available for only imited periods of time.

Games could be saved to a RAM cart (BS-X adapter).

The base unit had a 512 Kbit memory (RAM) chip to boost the SNES's capabilities and 1 Megabit ROM
chip that contained the operating system needed to control the Satellaview. It also had a 256
Kbit flash memory if the user hadn't bought him/herself an BS-X Special Broadcast Cassette that
contained a 1 Megabit flash memory chip.

The BS-X cartridge resembles a Super Game Boy. It plugs into the cart slot as normal. Inside, it
has 8 MBits of ROM that holds the operating system and the interface software. It also holds and
extra 4 MBits of RAM. The little plug-in cart is actually a unique 'Flash ROM' cart that holds
game code without the use of Battery-Backed RAM. Unlike ROM, it can be wiped and overwritten by
special methods.

Super FX
========
The Super FX is a 10/21MHz RISC CPU developed by Argonaut Software used as a game enhancer by
several game tiles. Released SNES Super FX games included Yoshi's Island (best single-player
game on SNES, if you like platform games), Doom, Winter Gold, Dirt Trax FX, StarFox, Stunt Race
FX and Vortex. If you're lucky, you might find a copy of the unreleased Starfox 2 image floating
around, but its sound code is corrupt.

S-DD1
=====
The S-DD1 is a custom data decompression chip that can decompress data in real- time as the SNES
DMA's data from the ROM to RAM. Only two known games use the chip: Star Ocean and Street Fighter
Alpha 2.

The chip uses a compression algorithm which is now known and included in snes9xTYL, so decompressed graphics packs aren't needed anymore

SA-1
====
The SA-1 is a fast, custom 65c816 8/16-bit processor, the same as inside the SNES itself, but
clocked at 10MHz compared to a maximum of 3.58MHz for the CPU inside the SNES.

The SA-1 isn't just a CPU, it also contains some extra circuits developed by Nintendo which
includes some very fast RAM, a memory mapper, DMA and, several real-time timers. These include
Mario RPG, Kirby Superstar and Paradius 3.

OBC1
====
OBC1 chip (for Metal Combat)

C4
==
The C4 is custom Capcom chip used only in the Megaman X2 and Megaman X3 games. It can scale and
rotate images, draw line-vector objects and do some simple maths to rotate
