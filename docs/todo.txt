11-25: 
	wiring WORKS. Dumped Super Mario SRAM, Push over ROM and Super Mario World ROM. All worked.
	the issues i had were literally just loose wiring. pushing them down fixed it.

12-5: Header reading works! Need to get a real PCB produced.

Pilotwings. 3 dumps without reseating the cart.
	First dump: off a few bytes.
	Second dump: exact match to clean rom 
	Third dump: off a few bytes (different from the first one)
	
	Log:
		jered@raspberrypi:~/git/super-copier-sn $ ./superCopierSN
